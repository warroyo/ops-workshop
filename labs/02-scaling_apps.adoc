= Scaling Apps

== Overview

In this lab we will be scaling our previous application

== Set up the working dir

. Change the working directory to be _ops-workshop/labs/my_work/dotnet-core-sample_

== Manually scale the application

. scale the application using the cli

----
$ cf scale -i 3 <your-initials>-sample-app
----

. view your app instances

----
$ cf app <your-initials>-sample-app
----

. you should see multiple instances running now

. scale your instances back down

----
$ cf scale -i 1 <your-initials>-sample-app
----

== Set up Autoscaling

. we now will set up autoscaling


. download the https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcf-app-autoscaler[autoscaler cli] from pivnet. scaling can also be done via the appsman UI if necessary

. install the plugin

----
$ cf install-plugin /path/to/download
----

. list the apps that are using autoscaling

----
$ cf autoscaling-apps
----

. enable autoscaling on your app

image::autoscale.png[]

. set your instance limits

----
$ cf update-autoscaling-limits <your-initials>-sample-app 2 4
----

. set an http_throughput scaling rule

----
$ cf create-autoscaling-rule <your-initials>-sample-app http_throughput 5 10
----

== Triggering a Scale

. create some http load using vegeta

. change into the _tools/vegeta_ directory in this repo. there is a binary for mac or windows in there

. get your apps route

----
$ cf app <your-initials>-sample-app
----

. run vegeta, for windows add _.exe_ to the command
----
$ echo "GET <your-route>" | ./vegeta attack -duration=120s -rate 100 | tee results.bin | ./vegeta report
----

. in a separate window watch autoscaling events, you can also watch this in appsman

----
$ cf autoscaling-events <your-initials>-sample-app
----

. check the number of app instances 

----
$ cf app <your-initials>-sample-app
----


. after you see the app scaling and vegeta is done, you should see the app scale back down.
